## About

> This is me!

I love Computer Science. Artificial Intelligence is my passion. Very interested in UI/UX Design, and Web Development.
Penetration Testing and CTF are my newest hobbies. Been a guitarist since the 8th grade and been in love with music ever since.

> The Dream

I want to create a truly generalized AI that is better than humans in research and other intellectual enterprises.

> My definition of AI

This one's a bit odd but there's no real agreement on the definition of AI. So here's mine:
<blockquote><i>"An intelligent agent is one that can do things to which we would attribute intelligence if done by biological beings."</i></blockquote>
